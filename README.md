## About Me:
I‚Äôm Harsh Kumar, a results-driven Full Stack Developer and UI/UX Designer with 1.5+ years of experience in crafting seamless, scalable digital products that balance performance with aesthetics.

Currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electronics & Computer Science at KIIT University (Graduating 2027), I‚Äôve built and deployed over 10 full-stack projects utilizing React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. One of my notable projects is **Drizz Originals**, an e-commerce platform where I handled end-to-end development (frontend + backend), Razorpay payment integration, and optimized UI/UX for improved conversion rates.

Proficient in design tools such as **Figma**, I bridge the gap between developers and designers to create polished, user-friendly experiences. Additionally, I have started integrating **AI** and **Machine Learning** models (like LLaMA 4, Mistral, and OpenRouter APIs) into web workflows to create smarter, more personalized user interactions.

Currently open to:
- Freelance gigs
- Internships (remote/onsite)
- Collaborations in e-commerce, SaaS, or AI-powered products

Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre building something bold. I‚Äôm eager to contribute and grow with you.
